<h1>Design Process</h1>
During the design phase, we want to center the website through immersive storytelling and thematic consistency as the game we're developing out, "Bloodbound Alchemy" took place in the Medieval time period where the player is a sorcerer that uses dark magic to brew potions by using human materials. The use of dark backgrounds, weathered textures, and the blood red color tone matches with the "Bloodbound" theme, which creates a high-contrast, moody atmosphere typical of dark fantasy and alchemical lore.


The main purpose of the website is not only to expand on our company branding, it also allow users to share their thoughts and sugesstions through the discussion page. It is because the game "Bloodbound Alchemy" has a lot of story endings, which can be determined by the choices made by the players in the game. The players can discuss different views regarding on the story and share their experiences there as well.

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>

- Due to the restdb upgrades, we only can implement one web API for our website. The original plan of the website was to have 2 web API keys, one for the checkout page and one for the contact form. Due to this, we have to give up the contact form API as the checkout API would be more important than the form API.

- I was thinking to implement a like list where the user can "like" a product.


<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
The languages that I used for this project will be HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The setting up of API I used the RestDB which are used to store the upcoming order list and contact form list.
